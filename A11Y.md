In attempting to improve accessibility of our 'big brain' application, we have followed the Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) in implementing the features of our application. 
For each of the principles (perceivability, operability, understandability and robustness), we have aimed 
at a level of somewhere between AA and AAA.

1. Perceivability:

We have provided all non-text content with alternate texts to provide context for their purpose. All text content 
are also easily distinguishable and legible from their respective background environment as we have ensured at least 
4.5:1 contrast ratio for small text and 3:1 contrast for large text using https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/.

2. Operability:

In our application, all page actions support keyboard interactions as we have ensured that all interactive elements are 
accessable, with focus outline easily recognisable for keyboard users. All input fields are marked up with proper labels 
and the application is marked with headers/sections/mains/footers.

3. Understandability:

All interactive elements and their purpose are easily understandable throughout the interface of the application. Forms are marked 
appropriately with inputs being labelled. The behaviour of forms, inputs and buttons are also predictable. Error messages are 
descriptive in terms of instructing the user on how they can avoid it again. Roles of modal popups are also assigned via role 
announcements to improve understandability.

4. Robustness:

To ensure our application, our code is completely HTML compliant with all open tags matched with equivalent closing tags and all 
elements have their roles well defined. We have also ensured that our code complies with checks that cannot be detected by modern 
JS frameworks, making sure that no 2 elements would have the same IDs and IDs are properly referenced using htmlFor for inputs.
